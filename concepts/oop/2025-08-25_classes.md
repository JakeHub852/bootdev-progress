# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming Notes

## Classes

A **class** is a special type in an object-oriented language like Python.
If you squint, it’s kinda like a dictionary because it usually stores *named value pairs*.

```python
# Defines a new class called "Soldier"
# with three properties: health, armor, damage
class Soldier:
    health = 5
    armor = 3
    damage = 2
```

* Like strings, integers, or floats, a class is a **type**.
* Classes are **custom types you define**.

---

## Objects (Instances)

Objects are just **instances of a class**.

“Instance” just means *an example of* or *a specific case of*:

* "Lane is an instance of a human."
* "My Chemical Romance is an instance of a band."

```python
health = 50
# health is an instance of the integer type

aragorn = Soldier()
# aragorn is an instance of the Soldier class
```

Each new instance of a class is an **object**.

### Example

```python
class Archer:
    health = 40
    arrows = 10

# Create several instances of the Archer class
legolas = Archer()
bard = Archer()

print(legolas.health)  # 40
print(bard.arrows)     # 10
```

---

## Methods

Classes aren’t just like dictionaries. They’re more powerful because they can have **methods**.
A method is a function tied to a class that has access to its properties.

```python
class Soldier:
    health = 5

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.health -= damage

soldier_one = Soldier()
soldier_one.take_damage(2)
print(soldier_one.health)  # 3

soldier_two = Soldier()
soldier_two.take_damage(1)
print(soldier_two.health)  # 4
```

### Self

* The first parameter of any method is always the instance itself.
* By convention, this parameter is called `self`.
* `self` is a reference to the object, so you can use it to read/update its properties.

Methods are called directly on an object instance using the dot operator:

```python
my_object.my_method()
```

---

## Methods Can Return

Methods often mutate object properties instead of returning values.
But they can return values if needed — e.g., a “getter” that calculates and returns something.

```python
class Soldier:
    armor = 2
    num_weapons = 2

    def get_speed(self):
        speed = 10
        speed -= self.armor
        speed -= self.num_weapons
        return speed

soldier_one = Soldier()
print(soldier_one.get_speed())  # 6
```

---

## Methods vs. Functions

A method is the same as a function — except it’s tied directly to a class.

It *automatically* receives the object it was called on as its first parameter (`self`).

```python
class Soldier:
    health = 100

    def take_damage(self, damage, multiplier):
        damage = damage * multiplier
        self.health -= damage

dalinar = Soldier()
dalinar.take_damage(20, 2)   # dalinar passed implicitly as self
print(dalinar.health)        # 60

adolin = Soldier()
adolin.take_damage(10, 3)    # adolin passed implicitly as self
print(adolin.health)         # 70
```

* A function operates on external data passed in.
* A method can operate on *its own object’s data*.

---

## The OOP Debate

* Some developers prefer **functional programming** because it’s more explicit.
* Others prefer **object-oriented programming** because it groups data and behavior together.
* Neither paradigm is objectively “better.” The best developers understand both and use each as appropriate.
