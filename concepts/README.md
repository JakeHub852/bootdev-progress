# 📘 Concepts & Notes

This folder contains Markdown notes and explanations based on topics I'm learning from Boot.dev.

Each file summarizes a single idea (like `stack traces`, `tuples`, or `scope`) to help reinforce understanding and serve as a quick reference later. Writing these helps me **think through the topic**, not just watch or read passively.

## 🧠 Covered So Far

- Python basics (variables, print vs return, scope)
- Function structure & behavior
- Stack traces, debugging
- Computing concepts (binary, scientific notation)
- Logic & conditionals (if, elif, boolean operators)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Moving onto Linux (meat and potatoes)

## 🗃️ Structure

Organized by category:
- `/basics` – fundamentals of Python
- `/computing` – deeper computing/math concepts
- `/errors` - errors amd handling exceptions
- `/functions` - organize logic, avoid reptition
- `/logic` – boolean reasoning, conditionals
- `/linux` - use shells and terminals in a Unix-like environment
