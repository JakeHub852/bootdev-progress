### ðŸ“… Date Completed

**June 30, 2025**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Overview

Youâ€™ve completed the full Linux course on Boot.dev, covering everything from basic terminal navigation to streams, permissions, piping, process management, and package tools. This course built a strong foundation in shell usage, system structure, and developer best practices in a Unix-like environment.

---

### ðŸ”‘ Key Topics Covered

* **Filesystem Structure**: root, home, directories, relative vs. absolute paths
* **Navigation & File Management**: `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`
* **File Inspection**: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`, `wc`, `grep`, `find`
* **Permissions**: file ownership, chmod (`+x`, `rwx`), user/group/other
* **Executables & Environment**: `PATH`, `$?`, `env`, `export`, `unset`
* **Shell Config**: `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, aliases, default shell customization
* **Streams**: stdout, stderr, stdin, redirection (`>`, `2>`)
* **Piping & Process Management**: `|`, `ps aux`, `kill`, `top`, `Ctrl+C`
* **Manuals & Help**: `man`, `--help`, `-h`, positional arguments
* **Unix Philosophy**: do one thing well, handle text streams, work together
* **Package Management**: `apt`, `brew`, `webi`, dependencies, updating
* **Editors**: Neovim, VS Code, and alternatives

### ðŸ§  What You Now Know

* Confident navigation and scripting inside a Unix terminal
* Managing files, directories, and permissions via shell
* Using command-line tools to parse, inspect, and manipulate data
* Redirecting streams and chaining commands into powerful workflows
* Understanding and using package managers to install and maintain developer tools
* Building a modern, developer-friendly Linux CLI environment
* Knowing when to consult `man`, how to search within it, and how to help yourself with built-in documentation

---

### ðŸ’» Tools & Workflow Impact

You now have the technical and philosophical groundwork to:

* Customize your terminal environment effectively
* Set up modern development machines using shell scripts
* Build reliable CLI workflows and automations
* Troubleshoot with clarity using `ps`, `top`, and exit codes
* Rely less on GUI and more on text streams and composable tools
* Transition smoothly into Bash scripting, server ops, and Linux development

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

* Practice daily CLI navigation and scripting
* Begin Bash scripting or dive deeper into Git
* Set up and maintain dotfiles or shell configuration repos
* Explore setting up your own local server or using Linux containers
* Consider trying Arch, Debian minimal, or a server distro when ready
