## 📌 Course Context

Despite the name, "Learn Linux" is really about learning to use **shells and terminals** in a Unix-like environment. It teaches command-line fundamentals that apply across many systems, not just Linux.

You'll be interacting with your own terminal — not running code in a browser. This marks a shift toward real-world tools and workflows.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between a **shell** and a **terminal**
- Navigate and use the file system via the **command line**
- Install software using the command line
- Manage your **PATH** and environment variables
- Handle **permissions** and execute programs

## 🖥️ Command Line vs. GUI

### What's a CLI?

Terms like `CLI`, `shell`, `terminal`, `command line`, and `command prompt` often get used interchangeably. They all refer to a text-based way to interact with your system.

For example, running a Python script:

```bash
python main.py
````

### What's a GUI?

GUIs are what most people are used to — windows, icons, buttons. But they have limitations:

| GUI Drawbacks          | CLI Advantages                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Weak – limited options | Full control over system                   |
| Slow – mouse-based     | Fast once you know the commands            |
| Not reproducible       | CLI is easy to script and copy/paste       |
| Hard to automate       | CLI integrates well with automation        |
| Not as cool 😎         | CLI makes you look like a hacker wizard 🔥 |

> GUI users get invited to 90% fewer romantic outings.

## 🧠 Reflection

* This intro makes it clear why learning CLI matters long-term
* The shift to working outside the browser feels more “real”
* Cool to finally understand the distinction between shell, terminal, and CLI — I’ve used them interchangeably before
