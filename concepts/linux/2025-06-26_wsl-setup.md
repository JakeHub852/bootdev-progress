# 🧰 Installing WSL 2 on Windows

> 📍 Lesson: Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux

---

## 📖 Summary

If you're on Windows, WSL 2 gives you a full Linux shell without dual booting. It’s an official Microsoft product and lets you run a Linux CLI alongside your normal desktop environment — no VM, no hassle. Mac and Linux users can skip this step since their systems are already Unix-like.

---

## 💻 Why Use WSL 2?

- Built-in Windows Command Prompt is... not great.
- WSL 2 is modern, stable, and supported.
- Full Linux distro inside Windows — great for dev work.
- Keeps Linux and Windows filesystems **separate** (use Linux side for code).
- No need to dual boot or reformat.

## ✅ Installation Steps

### 1. Run Windows Update
- Open **"Windows Update Settings"** from the Start Menu
- Click **"Check for updates"**
- Install all updates and **restart**

### 2. Install WSL and Ubuntu
- Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** (`cmd.exe`)
- Run:
  ```bash
  wsl --install
````

> If that fails: try

```bash
wsl --install Ubuntu
```

* Restart your computer

### 3. Launch Ubuntu

* After restart, you should see Ubuntu auto-launch
* If not, search for “Ubuntu” in the Start Menu and run it manually
* Set a **username** (lowercase) and **password**
* Type:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello world"
  ```

  and check that it prints properly.

---

## 🧪 Test WSL Installation

Use the command:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

This confirms WSL is installed and running with version info.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

**Error: A required feature is not installed?**

* Open "Windows Features"
* Enable both:

  * **Hyper-V Management Tools**
  * **Hyper-V Platform**

You may also need to enable **Virtualization** in BIOS.

👉 Still stuck?
Check the official WSL docs:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)

Or ask in the Boot.dev Discord.

## 🧠 Notes & Reflections

* I already knew WSL existed, but didn’t realize how complete it is now with version 2
* Makes sense to keep code on the Linux side and everything else on the Windows side
* This is probably the cleanest Linux-on-Windows setup possible without a full VM
