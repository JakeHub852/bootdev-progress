# 🧩 Code Snippets

This folder contains small, functional Python code examples I've written while working through lessons on Boot.dev.

Each snippet demonstrates a specific concept, function, or use case — from math and loops to boolean logic and list manipulation. These are not polished projects but *building blocks* to reinforce what I'm learning.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Math & expressions
- Functions (basic, default values, multiple parameters)
- Loops (for, while)
- Logic & comparisons (if, elif, boolean logic)
- Working with lists and tuples
- Slicing, concatenation, max/min values
- Real-world inspired examples (combat systems, filtering messages, team-splitting)

## 📁 Structure

Files are dated. Some folders (e.g. `/lists`, `/logic`) group related snippets as I go deeper into each topic.
