  - Printed variable values using `print(my_height)`.
- Explored **mathematical operators**:
  - `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division.

in the 2nd list and what items are needed to complete it.
- Can be found in code-snippets/computing/lists  **``alchemy-ingredients``**.

## 2025-06-15
- Moved onto dictionaries. Having trouble with Nesting (accessing values inside a list inside a dictionary).
- Dictionaries are used to store data in **key** - **value** pairs.
- Added function that counts enemies and adds them to dictionary. Increments the counter or adds a new key for a new enemy.
- Using iterating through dictionary key value pairs to count enemies.
- It's tricky but the most important part is defining the key and then it's value
using a for loop. 

## 2025-06-16
- You can chain dictionary keys to access a dictionary inside of another dictionary.
- Added code-snippet **``merge-dictionaries``** and concept **``dictionaries-contd.md``**.
- Moving onto **sets**.
- Sets are like Lists, but they are unordered and they guarantee uniqueness. Only ONE of each value can be in a set.
- Added **``remove-duplicates``** to code-snippets with 3 different methods of solving problem.
- **``counting-vowels``** added to code-snippets.
- We can use some of the "normal" mathematical operations on sets. For example, you can subtract one set from another.
 It removes all the values in the second set from the first set.
 - An example can be found in my code-snippets. **``set-subtraction``**.
- Moving onto errors and exceptions in python.
- Example of try/ except and printing exceptions in **``get-player-record``** in code-snippets.
- Good example of why exception order matters in **``process-player-record``**.

## 2025-06-17
- Moving on with errors and exceptions.
- Python has many types of errors called exceptions (like IndexError and ZeroDivisionError). These are specific types of a general error type called Exception.
- What matters when handling errors is the type of the exception — not the error message (the string in quotes). So even if two errors have the same message, they’re treated differently if their types are different.
- This is especially important when working with errors from other files or libraries.
- Good example of raising exceptions in **``purchase-item``** in code-snippets.
- Going over some python basics now. Adding all numbers within a range. Finding the minimum number. Sorting using the type() function.
- Trying to figure out this problem on factorials but don't know how to get 0! = 1.
- Figured out what I was doing wrong. Need to initialize result variable at 1 (the base for factorials) not 0.

## 2025-06-17
- More practice. 
- Completed **``area-sum``** which takes a list of rectangles where each rectangle is a dictionary and calculates the area of each rectangle and returns the sum of all areas.
- Working on a problem that converts a list of strings into a single string with each word seperated by a ",".

## 2025-06-18
- Finished final problem on converting list of strings into a single string. 
- Can be found in code-snippets/practice **``join-strings``**.

## 2025-06-19
- Coming to the end of the basics course so just some light revision for today.

## 2025-06-20
- Read a nice little piece by Tim Peters, a long time Pythonista.
- The Zen of Python can be found in concepts/basics 

## 2025-06-21
- Fineshed basics course today.
- This course was a solid introduction to Python. The lessons were well explained and structured in a way that kept things engaging.
- A few sections were tricky, but nothing ever felt too overwhelming. Overall, it was a good balance of challenge and clarity.
- Looking forward to building on this foundation in the next course.
