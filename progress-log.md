## 🗓️ 2025-05-26 – Session 1

- Learned what code is: a sequence of instructions executed in order.
- Started working on the “Fantasy Quest” RPG project
- Practiced simple output and expressions with `print(250 + 75)`.
- Fixed a basic math bug in the Boot.dev code editor.
- Edited and corrected in-game dialogue using `print()` statements.
- Explored syntax vs logic errors and how to debug them.
- Fixed syntax error in `print((250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4)`.
- Understood why Python isn’t used in the browser:
  - Browsers run JavaScript natively, not Python.
  - Python workarounds like Brython or Pyodide are slow and limited.
- Learned what Python *is* good for: backend development, automation, and data analysis.
- Set up Git and GitHub repo (`boot.dev-progress`) for tracking progress.
- Committed first Markdown notes and code snippets using Git Bash.

## 🗓️ 2025-05-26 – Session 2

- Added a shell script (`mkdatefile.sh`) to generate date-formatted filenames.
- Learned the basics of **variables** in Python:
  - Variables store values using descriptive names (`my_height = 100`).
  - Values can be text strings or numbers and can change over time.
  - Printed variable values using `print(my_height)`.
- Explored **mathematical operators**:
  - `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division.
  - Used parentheses to control operation order: `(a + b + c) / 3`.
- Practiced applying math with variables to simulate health reduction.
- Added new Python snippet: `code-snippets/2025_05_26_armored-health.py`.
- Learned about **negative numbers** and their use in expressions.
- Introduced **comments**:
  - Single-line with `#`, multi-line using triple quotes `""" """` (docstrings).

## 📅 2025-05-26 - Session 3


- Practiced Git commands in Git Bash (add, commit, push).
- Switched from `nano` to **VSCode** for editing Markdown files.
  - Editing is smoother and formatting issues are gone.
  - Learned how to open folders and preview `.md` files in VSCode.
- Learned to use VSCode for writing clean, structured Markdown:
  - Used code blocks (` ```python `) for Python syntax highlighting.
  - Formatted lists, headings, and comments more clearly.
- Created and committed a combined `.md` file:
  - **`python-backend-vs-frontend.md`**
  - Explained why Python is good for backend, and why it’s not used for frontend.
- Began learning about f-strings.

## 📅 2025-05-27 - Session 1

- Continued learning about **NoneTypes**
- Added **`none-type.md`** concept file to concepts for later reference.
- **Dynamic typing** and **Static typing**.
- Added file to concepts.
- Used **concatenation** to combine variables.
- Did some simple math to calculate average scores in the game.
- Added **`character-report`** to code snippets.
- Use Git Bash to push to GitHub.
- Restructured Repo with new subfolders.

## 📅 2025-05-27 - Session 2
- Started work on **Functions**

## 📅 2025-05-28 - Session 1
- Continuing work on **functions**
- Created simple function to calculate the area of a circle.
- Learned about how **functions** can accept **multiple parameters**.
- Created and commited concept files for function basics and multiple parameters.
  - **`functions-basics.md`** and **`multiple-parameters.md`**
- Wrote code for triple attack in Fantasy Quest.
- Added **`area-of-circle.py`** and **`triple-attack.py`** to code-snippets.

## 📅 2025-05-28 - Session 2
- Understanding the difference between print() and return.
- Added **`print-vs-return.md`** and **`print-vs-return.py`** to concepts and snippets.
- Learned more about order of functions.
  - Added **`order-of-functions.md`** to concepts.
>* Define all functions before they are used.
>* Use a `main()` function as the entry point.
>* Call `main()` at the bottom of your file.
- Added **`farenheit-to-celcius.py`**  to code-snippets.

## 📅 2025-05-29 - Session 1
- Functions are defined using keyword **def**.

## 📅 2025-05-29 - Session 2
Had some serious issues with my local PC and Onedrive. Thankfully, it's all sorted now and I have purged both my PC and laptop with no files lost. Not a big fan of Onedrive right now.
Trying to return to some practice now.

## 📅 2025-05-30 - Session 1
- Returned to my work on functions.
- Wrote a simple program to convert hours into seconds.
